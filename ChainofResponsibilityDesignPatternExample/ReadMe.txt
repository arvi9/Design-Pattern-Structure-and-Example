 The Developer is reporting to Team Leader. Team Leader is reporting Project Leader and Project Leader is reporting to HR. Again the Team Leader can approve a maximum of 10 days leave. The Project Leader can approve leave up to a maximum of 20 Days and the HR can approve leave maximum 30 Days.

Suppose a developer wants to take a leave of 25 days. So, what the developer will do is he will send a request for 25 days’ leave to the Team Leader. The Team Leader will check whether he can approve the leave or not. As the leave is for 25 days and he can only approve up to 10 days, so he will forward the request to the Project Leader.
The Project Leader will check whether he can approve the leave or not. As the leave is for 25 days, the Project Leader will not approve the leave as his capacity is up to 20 days. So, what the project leader will do is he will pass the request to the HR and HR will check and approve the leave.
On the other hand, if the developer is asking for 5 days’ leave then this can be handled by the Team Leader and once the Team Leader handles this, he will not forward this request to Project Leader.
So, the point that you need to remember is once the request is handled by any handler then it should not forward that request to the next handler.
